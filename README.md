# Solana transaction

This app can be used to create and sign various Solana transactions at the click of a button. Transactions are signed with the `all all all all all all all all all all all all` mnemonic and its `m/44'/501'/0'/0'` address is used as the fee payer and something like the main actor in the transactions (e.g. sender, staker, ...).
